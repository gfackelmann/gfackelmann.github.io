I am a Marie Skłodowska Curie postdoctoral fellow investigating the evolution of the human microbiome in the era of plastics at the [Segata Lab of Computational Metagenomics](http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/people.html), University of Trento, Italy. My expertise lies in microbiome research and microbial ecology with a strong focus on computational metagenomics and statistical ecology. Other projects I'm involved in include studying gut metagenomes in relation to diet and cardiovascular health; food-to-gut microbial transmission; and the diversity of gut metagenomes in Westernized populations.

I completed my fast-track PhD program with _summa cum laude_ at Ulm University in Germany, where I was also the recipient of a doctoral scholarship from the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes). My research focused on the impacts of anthropogenic stressors on the gut microbiome of wildlife, which serves as an indicator of health. Here, I gained experience combining genomics, ecology, and bioinformatics (statistical modelling in R e.g. generalized linear mixed models, ordination analyses, dealing with non-normally distributed, compositional data with high zero inflation).

Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
