I am a Marie Sk≈Çodowska Curie postdoctoral fellow and EMBO postdoctoral fellowship awardee investigating the evolution of the human microbiome in the era of plastics at the [Segata Lab of Computational Metagenomics](http://segatalab.cibio.unitn.it/people.html), University of Trento, Italy. My expertise lies in <span style="color:blue">microbiome</span> research and <span style="color:blue">microbial ecology</span> with a strong focus on <span style="color:blue">computational metagenomics</span> and <span style="color:blue">statistical ecology</span>. Other projects I'm involved in include studying gut metagenomes in relation to diet and cardiovascular health; food-to-gut microbial <span style="color:blue">transmission</span>; and the diversity of gut metagenomes in Westernized populations.

I completed my fast-track PhD with _summa cum laude_ at Ulm University in Germany, where I was also the recipient of a doctoral scholarship from the German Academic Scholarship Foundation (Studienstiftung des deutschen Volkes). My research focused on the impacts of <span style="color:blue">anthropogenic stressors</span>, such as <span style="color:blue">microplastics</span> and anthropogenic habitat change, on the gut microbiome of wildlife. During this time, I gained experience combining genomics, ecology, and bioinformatics (statistical modelling in R e.g. generalized linear mixed models, ordination analyses, dealing with non-normally distributed, compositional data with high zero inflation).
